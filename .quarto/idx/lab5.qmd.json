Furthermore, among those variables we may want to find out which variables matter most, and which variables are not so important that we can ignore. Regression analysis can help us findings the answers to these questions.\n\nIn this workshop, we want to investigate factors that influence consumers' decision to join a green loyalty program -- This LP encourages behaviours from hotel guests that are good for environment (e.g., reuse towels).\n\n![Hotel receptionist (Image courtesy of Jingxi)](images/lab5_robot.jpg){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"50%\"}\n\nIn this lab, we consider the following case. A hotel manager who recently launch a green loyalty program (GLP) wants to know about factors that affect consumers' intention to join the hotel GLP. The hotel manager decides to develop a survey and asks the hotel's guests to fill in an offline survey. The survey form was handed in to hotel guests by a frontline service robot (see the image above). The survey contains items to measure the following constructs:\n\n-   Intention to join the green loyalty program\n\n-   Anticipated guilt if not joining the green loyalty program\n\n-   Perceived attractiveness of hotel receptionist\n\n-   Age\n\n-   Gender\n\n`Anticipated guilt`, `Perceived Attractiveness`, `Age`, `Gender` are called the independent variables and `Intention to join the green loyalty program` is the dependent variable. The notion of the dependent variable comes from our prediction that its value depends on the values of the independent variables. The relationship between `Intention to join the green LP` the and the four independent variables can be written as:\n\nIntention to join the green LP \\~ Anticipated Guilt + Perceived Attractiveness + Age + Gender + error.\n\nYou can read the above expression as a consumer' intention to join the green loyalty program is influenced by the consumer's anticipated of guilt, perceived attractiveness, age, and gender, and some unknown factors represented by an error term. The relationship can be represented by a mathematical expression as below. The names of the variables are shortened.\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\nIntent = \\beta_0 +  \\beta_1 * Guilt + \\beta_2 * Attract + \\beta_3 * Age + \\beta_4 * Gender.\n\\end{equation}\n```\nwhere $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, $\\beta_3$, and $\\beta_4$ are parameters that capture the impact of each of the independent variables on `intention`.\n\nWe use regression procedure in SPSS to find out the estimates for all parameters using sample data ($\\beta_0$ is just a constant so it is not of our interest).\n\n::: callout-important\nVariable `Intent`, `Guilt`, and `Attract` were average scores of a multi-item scale where each item in the scale were measured using a Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree. `Age` is a continuous variable, and `Gender` is a 0,1 variable.\n:::\n\nIf you want to examine whether `Guilt` is a significant factor, then you want to test $H0$: $\\beta_1=0$ against $H1$: $\\beta_1 \\ne 0$. SPSS will report the p-value associated with $H0$. If p-value is less than 0.05, you reject $H0$ otherwise retain it. If you reject $H0$, you can conclude that `Guilt` is a significant factor that influences `intent`.\n\nIf you hypothesize that `Guilt` is a significant factor and has a positive impact on satisfaction, then you want to test $H0$: $\\beta_1=0$ against $H1$: $\\beta_1 > 0$. This is a one-sided test because the alternative hypothesis has a 'greater' sign. **However, SPSS will always report the p-value associated with 2-sided test**. Therefore, you have to divide the reported p-value by 2. If this **halved p-value** (i.e., p-value/2) is less than 0.05, you reject $H0$ otherwise retain it. If you reject $H0$, you can conclude that `Guilt` has a significant positive influence on `Intent`.\n\n::: callout-important\nSPSS will always report the p-value associated with 2-sided test. \n\nFor one-sided test, you have to divide the reported p-value by half.\n\n:::\n\n## Conducting Multiple Regression with SPSS\n\n**Open RobotGLP.sav** -- Thanks to [Jingxi](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/jingxi-huang(b7eacd2f-0786-430a-ba51-776c57c8c86a).html) for allowing us to use a subset of her data to test the above model.\n\nTo conduct a regression analysis in SPSS, click the following: **Analyze**$\\rightarrow$**Regression**$\\rightarrow$**Linear.**\n\nEnter `Intent` into the dependent variable box.\n\nEnter `Guilt`,`Attract`, `Age,`Gender\\` into the independent variable(s) box.\n\n![](images/lab5_ols.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\nClick `OK`\n\nSPSS produces four tables. The first one does not offer much information. Therefore, we focus our attention to the next three tables.\n\n1.  ANOVA table: Is the model meaningful?\n\n    ![](images/lab5_anova.png){width=\"70%\"}\n\nThis table tells whether or not the model is meaningful. If the sig value is less than 0.05, then the model is meaningful. If p-value is greater than 0.05, then model should be dismissed and don't interpret other outputs. In this example, the sig. value is less than 0.05; therefore we have a meaningful model. We can proceed with the next output.\n\n2.  Model Summary table: How good is the model?\n\nHaving known the model is meaningful, how do we know whether it is good enough? The Model Summary table provides the answer to this question.\n\n![](images/lab5_rsq.png){width=\"70%\"}\n\nThe model summary table tells you how well the independent variables explain variation in the dependent variable. The adjusted $R^2$ is 0.311 indicating that about 31% of the variation in the intention score is explained by the four independent variables (Guilt, Attract, Age, and Gender). Theoretically, the maximum possible value for adjusted R-square is 100% indicating a perfect model!\n\nAdjusted $R^2$ is $R^2$ that is adjusted for the number of independent variables in the model. The more independent variable you have in the model, the larger the $R^2$ will be. The adjusted $R^2$ prevents the inflation. You can use the following convention to qualify the impact of the set of the independent variables on the dependent variable[^lab5-1]:\n\n[^lab5-1]: Ellis, Paul D. 2011. The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes, p.41\n\n$R^2$ ≥ 0.02 small effect\n\n≥ 0.13 medium\n\n≥ 0.26 large\n\n::: callout-important\n## Important\n\nKnowing the adjusted $R^2$, indicate the strength of the impact of Guilt, Attract, Age, and Gender.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\nMaximizing $R^2$ value should not be your main goal in regression. Do not be tempted to select variables with the aim of increasing $R^2$ value. $R^2$ value in social sciences are typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.5. Selecting variables should be motivated by theories.\n:::\n\n3.  Coefficients\n\n![](images/lab5_coefs.png){width=\"110%\"}\n\nThis table tells us which of the independent variables significantly explain or predict the dependent variable. In this case three variables significantly explain `Intent`. These are `Guilt`, `Attract`, and `Age`, whereas `Gender` is not significant. Furthermore, the standardized beta values tell us which variable has the strongest impact on `Intent`. In this case `Attract` is the strongest predictor followed by `Guilt` and `Age`.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Task\n\nIf you want to make a prediction, use the unstandardized coefficients (B). If a female respondent aged 20 assigned a rating of three on `Guilt`, `Attract` can you predict her intention level? (round-off your answer)\n:::\n\n## Multicollinearity Problems\n\nHigh correlation among independent variables is problematic in multiple regression because it is hard for us to determine the individual contribution of each of the independent variables in the model. For example, if `Attract` is highly correlated with `Guilt`, then we cannot conclude that `Attract` have the strongest influence on `Intent` because `Guilt` also gives contribution to the magnitude of Attract-Intent relationship (it looks stronger than it should be). In other words, the coefficients associated with the regression estimates are biased -- not the same as their true population values.\n\nThe situation where an independent variable is highly correlated with another variable is referred to as multicollinearity problem. To diagnose whether multicollinearity exists, you can check it in two ways.\n\n1.  Inspect the correlation coefficient among the independent variables. To do correlation analysis in SPSS, follow this step: **Analyze**$\\rightarrow$**Correlation**$\\rightarrow$**Bivariate**. If two variables is highly correlated with the correlation coefficient is larger than 0.9, your model may suffer from a multicollinearity problem. In practice, you should be cautious, if the correlation is 0.7.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Task\n\nCheck the correlation coefficients among the predictors in the model.\n:::\n\n2.  Rerun your regression.\n\n-   Click: **Analyze**$\\rightarrow$**Regression**$\\rightarrow$**Linear**.\n\n-   Click `Statistics` options.\n\n-   Select `Collinearity diagnostic`. Click `Continue` and Click `OK`.\n\n-   Inspect the **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor** values in the output.\n\n::: callout-tip\nMulticollinearity exists if VIF (variance inflation factor) \\> 10.\n:::\n\n![](images/lab5_vif.png){width=\"110%\"}\n\n::: callout-note\n## Task\n\nSee the above output, does the model suffer from a multicollinearity problem?\n:::\n\n## If Multicollinearity Exists\n\nWhat should you do if multicollinearity exists?\n\nYou can deal with it using one of the following techniques:\n\n1.  Omit one or more highly correlated independent variables\n\n2.  Create a composite variable e.g., by taking the average score of two variables if the two variables causes multicollinearity **averaging** or using Principle Component Analysis (beyond the scope of our workshops)\n\n3.  Use the model that suffers from multicollinearity but for prediction purposes only.\n\n4.

If p > 0.05, do not interpret further. |\n| **Assess Model Explanatory Power** | Output: `Model Summary` Table | Look at **Adjusted R Square** | Indicates the **percentage of variance** in the dependent variable explained by the model. **Guidelines:** ≥ 0.02 (small), ≥ 0.13 (medium), ≥ 0.26 (large). |\n| **Interpret Individual Predictors** | Output: `Coefficients` Table | Check **Sig.**, **B**, and **Beta** columns | **Significance:** `Sig. < 0.05` = variable is a significant predictor.<br>**Strength:** Compare **Standardized Coefficients (Beta)**; higher absolute value = stronger effect.<br>**Prediction:** Use **Unstandardized Coefficients (B)** in the regression equation. |\n| **Diagnose Multicollinearity** | 1. **Correlation:** `Analyze` → `Correlate` → `Bivariate`<br>2. **VIF:** In Linear Regression dialog, click `Statistics` → Check `Collinearity diagnostics` | Check correlation matrix and VIF values | **Problem if:** Correlation between predictors > **0.7** (caution) or > **0.9** (serious).<br>**Or if:** **VIF > 10** in the coefficients table. |\n\n## 💡 Essential Concepts & Step-by-Step Workflow\n\n### 1. The Complete Regression Workflow\n1.  **Run the Regression:** `Analyze` → `Regression` → `Linear`. Specify your dependent (`Intent`) and independent variables (`Guilt`, `Attract`, `Age`, `Gender`).\n2.  **Check Overall Model:** Look at the **ANOVA table**. **Proceed only if Sig. (p) < 0.05**.\n3.  **Check Explanatory Power:** Look at the **Adjusted R²** in the `Model Summary` table.\n4.  **Interpret Predictors:** In the `Coefficients` table:\n    *   Identify significant predictors (`Sig. < 0.05`).\n    *   Use **Beta** to compare the relative strength of significant predictors.\n5.  **Check for Multicollinearity:** Re-run regression with `Collinearity diagnostics` in `Statistics`. Ensure all **VIF values are < 10**.\n\n### 2. Interpreting Key Outputs\n*   **The Regression Equation:** Use the *Unstandardized Coefficients (B)* to form the equation for prediction:\n    `Intent = B₀ + (B₁ * Guilt) + (B₂ * Attract) + (B₃ * Age) + (B₄ * Gender)`\n*   **Making a Prediction (Example from Lab Task):** For a female (`Gender=1`), aged 20, with `Guilt=3` and `Attract=5`:\n    1.  Find the *B* coefficients and constant from your output.\n    2.  Plug into equation: `Intent = B₀ + (B₁ * Guilt) + (B₂ * Attract) + (B₃ * Age) + (B₄ * Gender)`\n    3.  Calculate to predict the intention score.\n*   **One-tailed vs. Two-tailed Tests:** SPSS reports **two-tailed p-values**. For a **one-tailed test** (directional hypothesis, e.g., `H1: β₁ > 0`), **divide the reported p-value by 2**.\n\n### 3. Dealing with Multicollinearity\nIf you detect multicollinearity (VIF > 10 or very high correlations), consider these remedies:\n1.  **Remove Variables:** Omit one of the highly correlated independent variables.\n2.  **Combine Variables:** Create a composite score (e.g., average) if the correlated variables measure a similar construct.\n3.  **Purpose-Limited Use:** Use the model **only for prediction**, not for interpreting individual coefficients.\n4.  **Collect More Data:** Increase your sample size.\n\n## ▶️ Step-by-Step Practice Task\n1.  **Run the Analysis:** Open `RobotGLP.sav`. Run `Analyze` → `Regression` → `Linear` with `Intent` as Dependent and `Guilt`, `Attract`, `Age`, `Gender` as Independents. Click `OK`.\n2.  **Interpret Model Fit:**\n    *   **ANOVA Table:** Is the overall model significant (Sig. < 0.05)?\n    *   **Model Summary:** What is the Adjusted R²? How would you describe its size?\n3.  **Interpret Predictors:** In the `Coefficients` table:\n    *   Which variables are significant predictors of `Intent` (Sig. < 0.05)?\n    *   Among the significant ones, which has the strongest effect (largest absolute **Beta** value)?\n4.  **Check for Multicollinearity:**\n    *   Re-run the regression, clicking `Statistics` and checking `Collinearity diagnostics`.\n    *   Check the VIF values in the new `Coefficients` table. Is multicollinearity a problem (VIF > 10)?\n5.  **Make a Prediction:** Use the *Unstandardized Coefficients (B)* to predict the `Intent` score for a 20-year-old female with `Guilt=3` and `Attract=5`.\n\n---\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lab5.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
