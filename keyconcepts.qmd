# Levels of Measurement in Marketing Research

There are four levels of measurement or four types of data known as the NOIR classification: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio.

## Why Should You Care?

As a marketer, you run surveys, track sales, and study customers. The type of data you collect determines: - What questions you can ask. - Which charts you can use. - What statistics you can calculate (average, ranking, etc.). - How you can interpret the results.

Getting this right stops you from making silly mistakes, like calculating the "average" gender or ranking shoe sizes as if they’re preferences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Nominal ("The Category" Level)

-   What it is: Pure labels or categories with **no order, ranking, or mathematical meaning**.
-   Key Question: "Can I put these into distinct groups?"
-   Marketing Examples:
    -   Gender: Male, Female, Non-binary
    -   Brand Name: Nike, Apple, Coca-Cola
    -   Marital Status: Single, Married, Divorced
    -   Yes/No Questions: "Did you purchase this? (Yes/No)"
    -   Favorite Color: Blue, Red, Green
-   What you can do: Count them, calculate **mode** (most frequent category), and use pie charts or bar charts.
-   What you CAN'T do: Calculate an average, rank them, or say one is "more than" another.
-   Memory Trick: **Nominal** sounds like **"name."**

## 2. Ordinal (The "Rank Order" Level)

-   What it is: Categories with a **meaningful order or rank**, but the *differences between ranks are not equal or known*.
-   Key Question: "Can I arrange these in a meaningful sequence?"
-   Marketing Examples:
    -   Customer Satisfaction: Very Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, Very Satisfied
    -   Socioeconomic Status: Low, Middle, High Income
    -   Contest Placement: 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place
    -   Size: Small, Medium, Large
-   What you can do: Count, mode, and now also **median** (middle value). You can rank them.
-   What you CAN'T do: Reliably calculate an **average (mean)** or say "the difference between Satisfied and Neutral is the same as between Neutral and Unsatisfied." The "distance" is subjective.
-   Memory Trick: **Ordinal** sounds like **"order."**

::: callout-important
While customer satisfaction ratings (like 1-5 stars or "Very Dissatisfied" to "Very Satisfied") or any Likert scales (1= "Strongly Disagree", 7 = "Strongly Agree") are technically ordinal, marketers often treat them as interval data for practical analysis. This is a common and often necessary compromise that lets us use more powerful statistical tools.

If satisfaction is treated as an interval scale. We can calculate its average score. CEOs like it. CEOs don't want to hear "the median satisfaction is 4." They want: ✓ "Our average satisfaction is 3.65" ✓ "That's up from 3.42 last quarter" ✓ "We're aiming for 4.0 by year-end"
:::

## 3. Interval (The "Equal Distance" Level)

-   What it is: Numeric scales where the **differences between values are meaningful and equal**, but there is **no true zero starting point**.
-   Key Question: "Can I measure the exact difference between points, but zero doesn't mean 'nothing'?"
-   Marketing Example:
    -   Temperature (in Celsius):\*\* The difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as between 30°C and 40°C. But 0°C doesn't mean "no temperature."
    -   Calendar Year: 2020, 2021, 2022. The difference between years is equal, but year 0 is arbitrary.
-   What you can do: Everything from before, **plus** you can now calculate the **mean (average)** and standard deviation, because distances are equal.
-   The Catch: You **cannot** say "30°C is twice as hot as 15°C" because the zero is arbitrary.
-   Memory Trick: **Interval** has **equal intervals**.

## 4. Ratio (The "Complete" Level)

-   What it is: The most powerful level. Has **all the properties of Interval data, plus a true, meaningful zero point**.
-   Key Question: "Can I say 'zero means none' and compare values as multiples?"
-   Marketing Examples:
    -   Sales Revenue: \$0 means no sales. \$100 is twice as much as \$50.
    -   Number of Customers: 0 customers means none. 10 customers is double 5 customers.
    -   Website Visits: 0 visits means none.
    -   Time Spent on a Webpage.
-   What you can do: **Everything!** All statistics: mode, median, mean, and also ratios (e.g., "Product A sold 2.5 times more than Product B").
-   Memory Trick: **Ratio** lets you make true **ratios** and comparisons.

## Real Marketing Scenario: Launching a New Energy Drink

-   **Nominal Data:** *"Which flavour did you choose?"* (Citrus, Berry, Tropical) → Use a **bar chart** to see the most popular flavor (mode).
-   **Ordinal Data:** *"Rank your preference* → Find most preferred, least preferred flavour.
-   **Interval/Ratio Data:** *"How many cans did you purchase last month?"* → Calculate the **average** purchase per customer and see if one segment buys **twice as much** (ratio) as another.

**Remember:** The level of measurement is a **ladder**. Data at a higher level (like Ratio) can be treated as a lower level (e.g., you can just categorize age groups → Ordinal), but you lose information. You can't go the other way!

Mastering this helps you ask better questions, choose the right tools, and make smarter, data-driven marketing decisions.
